# India-and-its-Neihbouring-countries-Debt-Statistics

# Objective
If you have been following new recently, you may have come across various headlines like "South Asia in Chinese Debt Trap", "Economic crisis in Sri Lanka", "Failing economy of Pakistan", etc. These news articles made me curious to look into bilateral lendings between 2 countries. Using python, I developed a script to download PPG Bilateral Debt data between 2 countries using World Bank API.

The project collects data of PPG bilateral lending between India and its neighbouring countries which include Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Maldives & Myanmar. I have wrangled and analysed data from last 20 years of each country individually and visualized the data in form of excel dashboard for easy understanding of lending trend.

# Conclusion
Bilateral Lending Growth: Total PPG bilateral lending has surged from under $500 million in 2000 to approximately $45 billion by 2020, reflecting consistent growth over the past two decades.
Top Debtor: Bhutan emerged as the largest recipient, securing nearly $18 billion in bilateral loans during this period.
Lowest Recipient: Nepal received the least bilateral funding, totaling less than $1 billion.
Economic Impact: Bilateral lending to neighboring countries constitutes roughly 1.2% of India's overall GDP.
Financial Risk: In the event of a default by any neighboring nation, the potential impact on India's financial sector is expected to be minimal based on the available data.
